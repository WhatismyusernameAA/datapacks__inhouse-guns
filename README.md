# INHOUSE GUNS (1.21.2)
### *version: 1.0*

This datapack adds craftable (vanilla friendly, I hope) guns to minecraft, as well as a few other mechanics related to them.

This datapack is still very much a work in progress, and updates will be slow and in between due to my other responsibilities. I hope to implement various other features that have been circling in my head in the future.

*Added guns:*
- Powder Rifle
- Scattergun

*To be added:*
- Bamboo Hand Cannon
- Precision Revolver
- Augments/Enchantments (For progression?)
- Ranger Hut (For descovering new augments, as well as to obtain weapons)
- Nether Forge
