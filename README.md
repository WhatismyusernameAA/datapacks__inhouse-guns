# INHOUSE GUNS
### *latest version: 1.1 (1.21.4)*

This datapack adds craftable (vanilla friendly, I hope) guns to Minecraft, as well as a few other mechanics related to them. Crafting, shooting, possibly adding augments and other items?

*This datapack is still very much a work in progress, and updates will be slow and in between due to my other responsibilities. I hope to implement various other features that have been circling in my head in the future.*

### ADDED FIREARMS:
- **Bamboo Cartridge**: A simple improvised firearm. Only reaches 30 blocks, does average damage, and breaks upon usage.

- **Powder Rifle**: Sharp but still deadly. Reaches 60 blocks, crits at 40 and beyond. Medium aiming and fire rate.

- **Scattergun**: For closer ranges and larger groups of opponents. Reaches 10 blocks, crits at 5 blocks or closer. A little slower to aim and fire than the Powder Rifle.

To craft ammunition for each of these weapons, you will need paper, gunpowder and a few nuggets of iron. For a round, just one is enough. You will need a lot more, four to be specific, for some shot.
